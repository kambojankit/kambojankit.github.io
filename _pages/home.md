    title: "About Me"
    excerpt: "I am an upbeat, outgoing person based in Gurgaon, India. In my free time I play or be with friends & family. <br />I have a passion for teaching which started during my secondary school days, as part time, Maths and Science trainer.<br />I have always been fascinated by technology, and there was never a second thought about what I wanted to be in my life.<br /> In the autumn of 2007, during my first year of college in Chandigarh, my love for programming started and has grown ever since. After graduating I began working full time as a Software Engineer, with Sears Holdings, India. While I still enjoyed it, for the most part, I felt like something was missing.<br />That's when I realized my appetite for teaching has grown, and I upgraded myself into training people on different languages and technologies.<br />I now work as a full time Software Consultant and Trainer."
