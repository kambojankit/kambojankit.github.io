## Introduction

Namaste, I'm Ankit Kamboj, currently based in **Pune, India**. I write this blog and love to create tutorials on technologies that interest me. I am a Software Developer, Consultant and Trainer specializing in Mobile and Web Technologies. I have interest in Mathematics, Programming Languages, Web Development, Software Design etc.

Currently working as an **Senior Engineer** with **Exadatum**. I took undergraduate degree in Computer Science Engineering from Kurukshetra University, India. My initial stint in training was teaching primarily Computers, Mathematics and Science to under-grads.

I now spend most of my time writing code, training and solving challenging and interesting business problems.

When I'm not coding, I like to write blogs and articles on topics of my interest or providing Trainings and mentorship, on different Technologies in Mobile and Web Space.
